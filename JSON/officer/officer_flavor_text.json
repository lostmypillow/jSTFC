After a tour of duty aboard the USS Farragut, Kirk found himself assigned to Starfleet\u2019s most prolific vessel; The USS Enterprise. In 2265, at the age of thirty-two, Kirk was granted command of the Enterprise from Captain Pike. It was the proudest day of his father\u2019s life.\nKirk went on to serve with distinction. Under his steadfast leadership, the Enterprise has survived wars, natural disasters, time travel and near galactic destruction.

But when you have been a Borg for as long as Seven, things like the niceties of social interaction are difficult.

While unapproachable and standoffish on the surface, Shran was ultimately an advocate for peaceful relations between Andorians and Humans.\n\nAs Commander of the warship Kumari, Shran was eager to oppose any and all threats to the prosperity of the Andorian people.

However, following a number of questionable dealings with unscrupulous business partners, Shran was forced to reconnect with the Imperial Guard in order to go into hiding and protect his family.

With her appointment as head of state, the new Terran Empress would accept nothing less than the unflinching love and loyalty of her new subjects - a price that Picard and his crew were unwilling to pay as they refused to bow down to a Bajoran leader. As punishment, they would be banished and routed from their homeland, with the ISS Enterprise-D cast into a wormhole to be discarded and forgotten. Although death seemed to be a certainty, the wormhole was in fact an interphasic rift, acting as a gateway to a parallel universe. Rather than the cold embrace of death, Picard and the crew of the ISS Enterprise-D have instead found themselves lost and adrift in a strange, new world..."}, {"id": 67002, "key": "officer_flavor_text", "text": "<color=#40CFFF>CLASS:</color> ENGINEERING\n<color=#40CFFF>GROUP:</color> MIRROR UNIVERSE\n<color=#40CFFF>FACTION:</color> TERRAN EMPIRE\n\nMuch like his counterpart from a parallel universe, Data was one of a number of Soong-type androids created by Dr. Noonien Soong in the 24th century. While originally intended to be put to work as a mining automaton, a chance encounter with Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the ISS Stargazer would see this android\u2019s purpose irrevocably altered. Using an elaborate cover story to fake his demise, Picard would free Data from his mining duties and offer him a position as crew member of the ISS Stargazer - a role which Data would eventually accept in the capacity of science officer.\n\nUnder the banner of Imperial Starfleet, Data became a key member of Picard\u2019s crew, being of vital importance to several operations. One of these missions would lead to the Stargazer obtaining illegal contraband from Coridan IX, which was revealed to be a cache of Borg components. Rather than leaving this technology to gather dust, Data instead opted to utilize the components in order to improve himself, augmenting his own Soong-type architecture with Borg components. This process would lead to Data becoming occupied with the concept of self-improvement, much to the chagrin of Captain Picard, who would encourage his science officer to focus on creation over improvement.\n\nWhen the ISS Enterprise-D was banished through an interphasic rift by the newly-crowned Terran Empress Kira Nerys, Data would find himself stranded in a peculiar, yet eerily familiar new realm. While seemingly confined to this unexplored dimension, Data was confronted with endless possibilities of creation, as well as opportunities to keep improving upon his own architecture. Intrigued by the prospects that presented themselves to him, finding a way back home was no longer a priority for Data."}, {"id": 68, "key": "officer_flavor_text", "text": "<color=#40CFFF>CLASS:</color> SCIENCE\n<color=#40CFFF>GROUP:</color> MUDD'S COMPANY\n<color=#40CFFF>FACTION:</color> NONE\n\nRo Mudd is Harry Mudd's half-human, half-bajoran daughter, and a notorious smuggler in her own right.
