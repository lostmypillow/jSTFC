Commissioned by Starfleet and constructed in Yorktown station in 2263, the ship was completed soon after the destruction of the previous Enterprise, which fell at the hands of Krall and his Swarm. The Enterprise-A follows the same basic configuration as its predecessor but was given more than a few notable upgrades. With the trials of the past behind them and the wonders of tomorrow ahead, this magnificent vessel will carry its crew into the far unknowns... To boldly go where no-one has gone before."

It was originally forged by Pakleds for rapid, high-risk scavenging pursuits in warzones and volatile space. The design has recently been manufactured by Independent engineers in an attempt to create an ideal Station-raiding vessel.\n\nThe unique profile of the Amalgam is due to the fusion of components from various types of ships found across the quadrant. Elements of Klingon, Federation, and Romulan ship parts are merged with salvage from various other worlds. The result is a ship that has heritage based in many of the most influential factions in the galaxy, while remaining distinctly unique."

It certainly was not a pretty sight, but it was sufficient to keep the vessel together on its return journey to Kronos.\nOddly enough, the captain of the ship was rather proud of the reputation it garnered after this incident, as well as the somewhat eerie image the protruding spikes gave to the ship\u2019s silhouette. He rechristened the vessel Kos\u2019Karii, after the wraith-like eels that prowl the blood rivers of Fek'Ihri, and devoted his vessel and crew to the rescue and transport of wounded allies."

At long range, a well-crewed Augur was more than capable of holding its own against the Klingon hordes, but in the short-range dogfights preferred by the Imperial Fleet, the Romulans found themselves at a disadvantage. Klingon D4s were too fast and nimble, easily flanking the slower Romulan battleships and hitting them at their weakest points.\nThis was unacceptable. To combat this threat, the Romulan Senate instructed esteemed physicist and engineer Tuvan Zin to design a new vessel that could outperform the D4 in short-range combat.\nTuvan was given three weeks. It was enough.\nUtilizing the rare Sigma Tritanium, Tuvan developed a vessel capable of maneuvering at near-light speed. The Velox\u2019 triple reinforced Sigma Tritanium hull plating is immensely flexible, with thermal protections capable of withstanding up to 6,000 degrees Kelvin. This allows it to take the kind of high-risk, high-mobility engagements that Romulan forces had never truly excelled in.\nIts weaponry was also expressly designed with Klingon vessels in mind. The Velox is armed with a bank of twenty-three disruptor banks and twelve photon-torpedo tubes, more than enough to overpower similarly nimble vessels.\nThe Velox is the perfect microcosm of the Romulan spirit; we will stand dominant no matter the cost or challenge."

The Empire\u2019s D4s and Bortas class vessels made up the bulk of their fleet, but they lacked the necessary combination of firepower and maneuverability that the Jem\u2019Hadar forces boasted. The Empire needed a counter.\nThe Krencha was designed with this in mind. Fast, nimble, and deadly in equal measure, it utilizes cutting-edge Sigma Dilithium-powered impulse engines, triple-reinforced Sigma Tritanium hull plating, and a massive array of forty-three disruptor banks and fifteen photon torpedo tubes. This makes the Krencha the fastest, most maneuverable, and deadly vessel in the Klingon Fleet. All of this power does come with a cost, however.
